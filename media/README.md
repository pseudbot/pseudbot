# Media
This is your home for Pseudbot's media files.

## Adding media
Place thematically-related media files together in subdirectories of this one.

## Using media
Mention Pseudbot in a tweet followed by the ðŸ–¼ emoji and a category.  If you
wanted to tweet a randomly-selected image from the `smart` directory at the
head of a copypasta response chain (note that your instance of Pseudbot will
have a different handle) you could tweet at the bot:
```
@pseudbot ðŸ–¼ smart
```

If you want to only tweet just an image with no attached copypasta chain, add a
second ðŸ–¼ emoji at the end of your tweet like so:
```
@pseudbot ðŸ–¼ smart ðŸ–¼
```
